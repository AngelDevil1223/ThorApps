                                    <div class="toggle-content">
                                        <p>
                                            There are three major issues with using the above approach:<br />
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Querying the SharePoint content database directly voids support from Microsoft as it can cause table locks and prevent SharePoint from working correctly.</li>
                                                <li>The report author has to figure out which field to access as SharePoint stores all list content in a single table with fields named like nvarchar1, nvarchar2 or datetime2, datetime3.</li>
                                                <li>The report author has no control over the reliability of the content the report reads, and users can change the fields in lists, breaking reports and providing users with invalid information.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            Reflex Reporting solves these problems, by creating a reporting database specifically for reports to read the content. The reporting database is made up of tables that represent the list structures defined in SharePoint and use easy to identify field names (i.e. the same field names the user sees in a list).
                                        </p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="row">
                                    <a class="toggle-title">Why should I choose Reflex Reporting – doesn’t SharePoint web services provide everything I need to produce reports?</a>

                                            SharePoint web services has the following issues:
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>You can’t query content from list instances across a site collection.</li>
                                                <li>The sorting, grouping, and summing functionality is very limited</li>
                                                <li>SharePoint web services is very slow to execute because queries must run through XML, web services and then SharePoint before eventually hitting the SQL database and then the data has go back through the same channel again before the report can read it.</li>
                                                <li>It’s slow to develop because the report author usually needs to manually craft a SOAP request (web service call) in a text editor. (i.e. no designer)</li>
                                                <li>The report author still has no control over the reliability of the content the report reads, and users can change the fields in lists, breaking reports and providing users with invalid information.</li>
                                                <li>This solution is not migratable. SSRS does not provide a SharePoint list connector or support SOAP requests to SharePoint Online lists.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Reflex Reporting avoids these problems, by allowing the report to query content directly from a SQL server database, providing all the performance and functions of SQL server (i.e. table indexes, sorting, grouping, summing etc). Virtually all reporting tools provide report authors with an easy to use interface to query SQL server tables and most report authors know and understand how to create a SQL query.

                                            Project Server integration has traditionally been done by hiring a software developer to build a custom component using the Project Server PSI to integrate between Project Server and other line of business systems or integration services, e.g. SAP.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The PSI is a set of web service method calls that only a software developer can leverage, but there are quirks and limitations (eg. only a limited size of change can be uploaded; some elements are managed through simple datasets while others are custom XML strings, add operations must be separated from update operations, it is complicated!). The result is buggy, flaky integration components and a Project Server implementation project that’s goes way over budget, over time and has limited functionality. More often than not hiring the right developer is rare and the developer finds themselves well out of their comfort zone.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            By wrapping the PSI in a user-friendly interface, the whole process is altogether much more straightforward, cheaper and more reliable than hiring a developer.

                                    <div class="toggle-content">
                                        The two Project Server solutions to time comparison reporting are through Baselines and the Archive database. The problem with baselines is there are only 10 slots to snapshot information into and you rely on the users to baseline a project into the right slot and at the right time. Plus, you can’t include information from other business systems or non-project related information (i.e. Custom Fields, or Resource Rates, even if it is stored in Project Server).<br />
                                        The problem with the archive database is that:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>the structure is designed to support backups and not reporting so it’s difficult to create a report from.</li>
                                            <li>it can’t be configured to snapshot only a small set of information or aggregated information.</li>
                                            <li>does not include other systems information.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Project Snapshots is designed to address these issues specifically.
