                        <p>ThorApps Online Services use a pay as you go usage model and a Payment Plan like a mobile phone plan. Payment Plans start at $100 per month and all plans include all features and unlimited users. </p>

                        <p>Only data usage is charged to a customer's <a href="/pricing">Payment Plan</a>, so we encourage you to use our $50 trial valid for 30 days to have a feel of how much data you consume and choose the plan that suits you best. Once your monthly plan limit is reached, you can either continue using ThorApps services, with additional usage charges applied to your invoice or have the services disabled until the next payment period begins. To check how much data you have consumed, please go to Account Settings (Cog on the top right corner), then click on Usage Report. </p>

                        <p>Yes, we provide every customer a free $50 credit valid for 30 days on their account on the first install to trial one single product or have full access to our suite of apps. The trial will be de-activated when you have consumed the $50 or ended the 30-day period, whichever comes first. Once the trial is de-activated, your reports will still exist, but your access is revoked. You will require a valid Payment Plan to regain access and create or export new reports. If this isn’t enough for your requirements, please contact us on info@thorapps.com.</p>
